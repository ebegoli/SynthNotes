# Anaconda

Anaconda is an open-source distribution of python that ships with several
common non-standard Python libraries. It is the defacto standard Python distro
for open source data science and combines package management and virtual 
environment creation into a single convenient service.

Anaconda is installed as a client service. Installing Anaconda only requires
downloading its installation script and executing it.
